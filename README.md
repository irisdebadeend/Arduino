# Technologies-for-connectivity
The code for the technologies for connectivity course at the TU/e.
For this code I found tutorials online and adapted from them.
Note that these are not referenced since this code is quite different and furthermore, I could not find those tutorials anymore.
With our module we can sense how close someone is and with that also the direction they are walking in.
This makes our module very versatile in functions because we can choose any distance with our sensors and add up to 6(!) sensors per arduino.
